User Service: Handles user registration, login, and profile management.

Submission Service: Manages the creation, modification, and status tracking of projects.

Task Service: Responsible for task creation, assignment, and completion tracking.

API Gateway: Acts as the entry point for all client requests, routing them to the appropriate microservice.

Eureka Service: Provides service discovery and ensures the appâ€™s scalability by managing all microservices.

Tech Stack
Spring Boot: Framework for building the microservices and the backend.

Spring Security: Handles authentication and authorization.

JWT (JSON Web Tokens): Secure authentication mechanism.

Eureka: Service discovery for microservices.

Databses: MySQL, PostgreSQL and MongoDB.

Maven: Dependency management and build tool.

RESTful APIs: Communication between microservices and external systems.

Docker: For externalizing microservices.
